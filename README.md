# loginshowcase
Just a first login design and a list with possible wordpress plugins if we will go with wordpress 

---- 
Added the colors to the left and right to give it a small touch of simons already. Would probably look nicer if somebody 
is good in graphics and make some colored images.



#### Useful Wordpress Login Plugins ####

https://wpforms.com/  ----- good looking login plugin for wordpress - one of the most used plugins for login with custom design

- has a drag and drop builder 
- already responsive

https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/ ---- would be the alternative to wpforms also often used wordpress login plugin

i think with either one of them we would be good to go although i would prefer wpforms i guess - if we consider to use wordpress
i could probably try and embedded it into a sample page

#### Useful additions ####

https://wordpress.org/plugins/login-lockdown/

plugin addition to prevent brute forcing - not sure if there would be something to brutforce .... maybe overprotective

https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextend-facebook-connect/

plugin to lock in with facebook, google , twitter --- something we should definitely consider to make it as easy as possible to be
part of the game

https://wordpress.org/plugins/linkedin-login/

same for linkedin

https://wordpress.org/plugins/prevent-concurrent-logins/

protection addition to prevent double login at the same time ... maybe also something we don´t really need but just in case it looks
good

https://wordpress.org/plugins/jonradio-remember-me/

remember me function so people don´t have to relogin if they close the tab and come back later to finish the ten attempts
